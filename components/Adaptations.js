      <h2>Adaptations & Variations</h2>
      <p>This plan is a flexible foundation. Here are a few ways to adapt it to your liking:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flavor Boosts:</strong>  Incorporate herbs, spices, lemon juice, garlic, and hot sauce to add variety and excitement to your meals without adding extra core ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Calorie Adjustments:</strong> Adjust portion sizes to meet your calorie goals. Add more quinoa or sweet potatoes for more calories, or reduce almond portions for fewer calories.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal Swaps:</strong> Replace broccoli and spinach with other seasonal vegetables like kale, cauliflower, or zucchini to keep things interesting and take advantage of fresh produce.</li>
        <li><strong>Snack Options:</strong> If needed, add simple snacks like fruit (apples, bananas, berries) or a handful of almonds between meals.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The key is to keep it minimalist and sustainable.  Don't be afraid to experiment within the framework of these core ingredients!</p>
